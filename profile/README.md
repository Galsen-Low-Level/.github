## Greetings  & Welcome to Galsen Low Level 


GLL encourages sharing, building and experimenting and helps others discover what low level offers and the possibilities it presents. 
We create low-level software to share with the local Senegalese community. 
Our aim is to create simple, non-overloaded software at all levels. 
Build software with a solid base. 
Build from the ground up. 

Give value to programming.

And so we love computing at every level. 💝
